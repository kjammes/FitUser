In my app

 - User is named as FitUser to avoid confusion
 - Username is not used, instead an email field is used.
 - Need to do some research and set secret properly using ENV variables or something for secret of JWT token
 - Refactor code and use username instead of email for authentication
 - Decide all the entities and their relationships for project.
